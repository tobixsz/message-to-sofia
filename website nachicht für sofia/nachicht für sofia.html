        <div id="top">The one thing i enjoyed the Most in the Last thew years was to dance with you, smoke with you and to Drink with you. Today the 1.7.23 the day After i realised that i might Love you, and i know by myself that i am a weirdo Loving you after one evening. I am a Person who Likes to cutt himself for Like 1 month and the only thing right know that stopping me to Cut myself was the thought of you Dancing with me. I know that i am a realy realy realy weird of talking Like this to such a beautifull Woman Like you. I realy never Talk to a Person Like you, i dont even know how to discribe you... When your reading this i am probably dead physically. I am already dead inside for a thew months now. Please swear one Thing to me, never Stop Dancing. As i First started Dancing with you i thought i would be in a Dream.you are so beatifull i don't even know why i got to dance with you when there were so many better men at this party, smarter, richer, just better men, the only thing i have to offer is a half decent body and that's all. Probably it was the Alcohol that Made YOU dance with a Guy like ME. i dont want to say that youre the reason that i kill myself, its otherwise, you are the reason i stopped thinking about Killing myself or cutting myself for nearly a day now. and that is realy much when you think of how mentally instable i am. The only reason why i do this is becous i am an dumb Guy who doesnt know what to do in the Future. You know what, i even dreamed of you Last night After i got Home.and the reason, i know, you dont Like me, is becouse you dont even Said goodbye to me after you left the Party or you only looked maybe a thew times in my eyes when we danced. I think i am realy good to know how poeple See each other and thats why i was such a good hider of my depressions. You can ask anyone of my Friends, noone even thought of me Killing myself couse im such a good actor. As i already Said, please never Stop Dancing, maybe you dont know, but you are the Most gorgeous Woman i've ever Seen in my Life when your Dancing, even Not Dancing, but  you we're drunk Dancing with someone Like me. I dont know how i get this Message to you, maybe i Just create a Website and simply Post that Message into it. So goodbye, unfortunately we do Not ever See us again even tho that probably happend anyway. Please just dont laugh about me becouse of that Message.</div>
        <div id="main"> I would Love to smoke cigarette with you but its too late, Goodbye.</div>
